### Ready Food App

This is the README file for the Ready Food App. Below you will find an overview of the application structure, functionalities, how to run it, and the implementation process for One-Time Password (OTP) verification.

---

### Overview

The Ready Food App is a web application built to facilitate food ordering. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting food orders. The application is developed using Go programming language and utilizes the Fiber framework for building web APIs.

### Application Structure

The application consists of the following main components:

- **`controller` Package**: Contains handlers for different API endpoints related to food orders.

- **`main` Package**: Contains the entry point of the application and setup for middleware and routes.

- **`database` Package**: Handles database connection and initialization.

- **`middleware` Package**: Provides middleware functions for logging, error handling, and CORS.

- **`routes` Package**: Defines API routes and registers them with the Fiber app.

### Features

- **Order Management**: Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete food orders.

- **Authentication Middleware**: Middleware for user authentication (currently commented out) can be easily integrated.

- **Logging Middleware**: Middleware to log HTTP requests and responses for debugging and monitoring purposes.

- **Error Handling Middleware**: Middleware to handle errors and return appropriate HTTP responses.

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Middleware**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for allowing requests from other origins.

### One-Time Password (OTP) Implementation Process

To enhance security and protect user accounts, the Ready Food App can implement a One-Time Password (OTP) verification process. This process involves generating a unique code that is sent to the user's registered mobile number or email address. The user must then input this code to verify their identity before accessing certain functionalities, such as account creation, login, or critical actions like updating personal information.

#### Steps for OTP Implementation:

1. **User Registration/Login:**
   - When a user registers or logs in, prompt them to provide their mobile number or email address.
   - Validate the provided contact information to ensure its format correctness.

2. **Generate OTP:**
   - Once the user's contact information is validated, generate a random numeric OTP code. 
   - The OTP should have a predefined expiration time (e.g., 5 minutes).
   - Store the generated OTP along with the user's contact information in a temporary storage (e.g., in-memory cache or database).

3. **Send OTP:**
   - Dispatch the generated OTP to the user's provided contact information via SMS or email.
   - Ensure that the OTP delivery method is secure and reliable to prevent interception or tampering.

4. **User Verification:**
   - Prompt the user to input the received OTP within the specified expiration time.
   - Validate the entered OTP against the stored OTP for the user's contact information.
   - If the OTP matches and is within the expiration time, proceed with user authentication or the requested action.
   - If the OTP is invalid or expired, prompt the user to retry or resend the OTP.

5. **Limit OTP Attempts:**
   - Implement a mechanism to limit the number of OTP verification attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
   - After reaching the maximum attempts, temporarily lock the user's account or enforce additional security measures.

6. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Log OTP generation, sending, and verification events for auditing and monitoring purposes.
   - Monitor OTP-related activities to detect and mitigate suspicious or malicious activities.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle failures during OTP generation, sending, and verification.
   - Provide clear error messages to guide users in case of OTP-related issues.

### Running the Application

To run the Ready Food App, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ADEMOLA200/ready-food.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd ready-food
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

5. Configure your database connection details in the `database.ConnectDB()` function in `main.go`.

6. Run the application:

   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

The application will start and listen for requests on port 3000 by default.

### API Documentation

The API endpoints provided by the Ready Food App can be found in the `controller` package. Each endpoint is associated with a specific handler function responsible for processing incoming requests.
